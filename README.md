# Apple-Picker-Tutorial

One interesting way we spiced up the game is adding a rotten apple. If the bad apple is caught then the player loses -1000 points. However if the apple is not caught
The round will not be ended for the player. To add to the difficulty we made the shade of the bad apple very close to the shade of a good apple. In the real world 
when you go apple picking, often times you pick an apple and then realize its a bad apple. So we wanted to in a round about way immitate that. If you have a good eye
you can see the different shade of color when a bad apple drops. To also add to the difficulty we increased the drop rate of all apples, as well as made the drop rate of
each bad apple to be .25.
